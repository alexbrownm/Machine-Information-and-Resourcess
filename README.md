What is a Machine?
A machine is a tool or device that uses energy to perform a task. Machines reduce human effort and can range from simple hand tools to complex computerized systems.

Types of Machines

Simple Machines:
Devices with few or no moving parts that make work easier (e.g., lever, pulley, wedge, inclined plane).

Complex Machines:
Made of two or more simple machines working together (e.g., automobiles, washing machines, robots).

Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

How Machines Work

Energy Input → Mechanical Process → Output Work

Controlled using gears, sensors, software, or electronics depending on the machine type.
